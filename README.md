Hardhat Sample Project

This repository is a simple example project using Hardhat as a Solidity development environment. It includes a basic smart contract, a testing setup, and a deployment script to demonstrate how smart contracts are compiled, tested, and deployed.

You can try running the following Hardhat commands:

npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts


These commands help you explore Hardhat features such as local blockchain, testing, gas reporting, and contract deployment.
